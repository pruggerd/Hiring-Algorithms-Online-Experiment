        Now, please state what number of seconds you think both recruiters will predict for your average task performance.

        {% if player.treatment == 'transp' %}
            The algorithm predicts a worse performance for participants who are female (+4.1 seconds), older (+0.75 seconds per year of age), have a higher level of education (+0.7 seconds per level of education) and solved round 9 more slowly (+0.5 seconds for each additional second in round 9).

        Your performance in Round 9 was: {{time9}} seconds.
