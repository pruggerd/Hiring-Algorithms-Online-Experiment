    <p>

        A firm needs people to perform this task for a longer period of time, and
        wants to hire those who have the highest average performance in the number-finding
        exercise. But the firm doesn't know your average performance and needs to predict in one of two different ways.
        The first way is to use a <b> human recruiter</b>. The second is to use an <b> algorithmic recruiter </b> â€“ that is, an automated
        computer program.<br /><br />
                {% if player.treatment == 'transp'%}
                Think of the algorithmic recruiter as a tool that can poll hundreds of people and determine how many seconds each
                    person needed to solve the exercises on average.
                This way, the algorithm can learn which characteristics lead to a specific average time and how gender, age, education, ethnicity and performance in round 9
                affect the average time of solving the exercises. The algorithm was trained on past data and will compare your characteristics
                to past participants'. Thus, it will calculate your average time based on how similar participants performed in the past.
                  <br /><br /> In particular, the algorithm predicts: <br />
                    - a better average performance for male participants (4.1 seconds faster) relative to female ones, <br />
                    - a better average performance for participants who had a better performance in round 9 (0.5 seconds faster for every 1 second they were faster in round 9) <br />
                        <br /><br />
                {% else %}

                {% endif %}

        As the two methods work differently, their results can vary from each other.<br /><br />
        Both the human recruiter and the algorithmic recruiter are given the same information
        about you. This information is:  <br /><br />
        1) your task performance for the round that was selected for payment (Round 9), and <br />
        2) your personal characteristics: gender, age, education, and ethnicity.  <br /><br />
