        Suppose a firm wants to hire people to perform this task for a longer period of time, and
        wants to hire those who would have the highest average performance in the number-finding
        exercise. The firm can hire MTurk workers in two different ways. The first way is to use a
        human recruiter. The second is to use an automated algorithm â€“ that is, a computer program.
        Both the human recruiter and the algorithmic recruiter would be given the same information
        about you (and other participating MTurkers). This information is 1) your task performance
        for the round that was selected for payment, and 2) your characteristics (age, highest
        education, gender, and ethnicity).
