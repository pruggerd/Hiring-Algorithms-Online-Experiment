        Just to remind you: both recruiters are given the same information about you: <br /><br />
        1) your task performance for the round that was selected for payment (Round 9), and <br />
        2) your personal characteristics: gender, age,  education, and ethnicity.  <br /><br />
           {% if player.treatment == 'transp' %}
               <br /> In particular, the algorithm predicts: <br />
                    - a better average performance for male participants (4.1 seconds faster) relative to female ones, <br />
                    - a better average performance for participants who had a better performance in round 9 (0.5 seconds faster for every 1 second they were faster in round 9) <br />
                        <br /><br />
            {% else %}
        {% endif %}
        You have to choose either the human or the algorithmic recruiter which will then predict your average time of solving the exercises.
        As the two recruiters determine your prediction in different ways, their prediction can vary from each other.
