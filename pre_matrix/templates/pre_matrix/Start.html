       In the next three pages you will see a table with 9 numbers. Your task is to find the two numbers which sum up to 100.
        For each exercise, you have a maximum time of 90 seconds. The aim is to submit the two correct numbers as fast as possible.  If you submit the wrong numbers,
        an error message will appear and you have to try again until
        time runs out and the next exercise appears.
        Your are now provided with the three training rounds.
