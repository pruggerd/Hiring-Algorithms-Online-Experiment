       In the next ten exercises, you will see a table with 9 numbers. Your task is to find the two numbers which sum to 100.
        For each exercise, you have a maximum time of 90 seconds. You will earn points based on how fast you write down the
        correct two numbers. If you submit the wrong numbers, an error message will appear and you have to try again until
        time runs out and the next exercise appears. Your number of points for an exercise is 90 minus the number of seconds
        it takes you to correctly solve it.
        One of the 10 exercises will be chosen for payment.
        After cumulating all points youâ€™ve earned during the HIT, they are converted to US Dollars, where 60 points earns 1 US Dollar.<br /><br />

        Before the real exercises start, you are provided with one training round, which does not affect your payments in any way.
