        Welcome! You will be given further instructions when the experiment starts, but we would like to inform you shortly about
            the game and lab rules beforehand.
                <br /><br />
            The experiment will last around 40 minutes. There are no trick questions or secret tips hidden in the experiment.
            You will have to make choices based on the information you receive. You will earn money as a result of these choices.
            How much you earn depends on the decisions you make during the experiment. You will be paid 3 euros as a show-up fee.  You can earn
     up to additional 8 Euros by conducting the experiment. You will be paid in cash right after the experiment is finished.

            <br /><br />
            Please remember that you are not allowed to communicate with other participants during the experiment. If you have any questions, please raise
            your hand and we will come by to answer them. Please don't touch the sheet of paper next to your keyboard until mentioned.


            <br /><br />
